  <div class="w3-container">
  <p>Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act. Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease your ability to function at work and at home.</p>

  <p>Depression symptoms can vary from mild to severe and can include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Feeling sad or having a depressed mood</li>
    <li>Loss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed</li>
    <li>Changes in appetite â€” weight loss or gain unrelated to dieting</li>
    <li>Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much</li>
    <li>Loss of energy or increased fatigue</li>
    <li>Feeling worthless or guilty</li>
    <li>Difficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h2>Self-help and Coping</h2>
  <p>There are a number of things people can do to help reduce the symptoms of depression. For many people, regular exercise helps create positive feeling and improves mood. Getting enough quality sleep on a regular basis, eating a healthy diet and avoiding alcohol (a depressant) can also help reduce symptoms of depression.</p>
  <p>Depression is a real illness and help is available. With proper diagnosis and treatment, the vast majority of people with depression will overcome it. If you are experiencing symptoms of depression, a first step is to see your family physician or psychiatrist. Talk about your concerns and request a thorough evaluation. This is a start to addressing your mental health needs.</p>
